I am passionate about programming and cybersecurity. Currently, I am pursuing several certifications as well as running my infrastructure at home.
My present plan is to earn the Network +, Security +, OSCP, OSEP, and beyond. My goal is to never stop learning and improving my craft as well as 
to use it to make companies and governments alike more security-focused and aware.
